# Introduction #

Simple Web Profiling offers an easy, simple and pragmatic way to profile Java Web Applications.

The project was initially launched by Atlassian but in 2003 it was abandoned or at least the development halted.

It allowed for a quick and painless performance diagnose off a web application without the need for "heavy weaponry".

The need to add some features to the library such as memory profiling and logging framework integration raised the need to "continue" the development taking a new path.

The goal of simplicity has been the core objective of the project.
